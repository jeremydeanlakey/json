# json

A library to make it easier for me to deal with json in Android. The code style is optimized to my preferences, and not common "best" Java practices.

Call me lazy, but I don't like trying to work with JSON in Java - with all the exception catching, static typing and excessive function calls.  This library tries to cut it down a little.
