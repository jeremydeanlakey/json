# json

A library to make it easier for me to deal with json in Android.

Call me lazy, but I don't like trying to work with JSON in Java - with all the exception catching, static typing and excessive function calls.  This library tries to cut it down a little.

I'm sure some would consider the style bad practice but it's intended for my use only.  :P
